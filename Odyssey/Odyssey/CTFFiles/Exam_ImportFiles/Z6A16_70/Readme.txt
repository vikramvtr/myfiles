Note about discount (classification) codes
==========================================

The codes included in our basedata are taken from the DfE websites:
* RAISEonline www.raiseonline.org/documentlibrary/ViewDocumentLibrary.aspx
* QAN Web Site https://collectdata.education.gov.uk/qwsweb

The DfE publish different codes for Key Stage 4 (KS4) and Post 16 discounting purposes.

As the basedata format only includes provision for a single discount code per award,
our basedata includes only the KS4 code from RAISEonline for awards with more than
one discount code (such as most AS qualifications).
